          <h1 itemprop="headline" class="title">The Most Expensive Car in the World</h1>
          <h2 itemprop="" class="sub-title">It's not even that fancy! Or is it?</h2>
          <p>Police officers should have the most advanced crime-fighting equipment to outsmart law-breakers.</p>
          <p>But to win a chasing game against elite road criminals and wealthy motoring offenders, they need cars with remarkable speed and sophistication.</p>
          <p>These cops never really intended to get the most luxurious vehicle, but obviously they had to. Do you know which country has the most powerful and most expensive patrol car?</p>
          <p>USA cops boast of their head-turning fleet of Hummer cars but these vehicles are far from being the most extravagant in the world. German law enforcers are not a tad intimidated by US since they drive a Porsche 911 - American taxpayers would have been furious had US police imitated this. Germans beat Americans but Italian police officers could easily outrun the German police cars with their fleet of $230,000-worth, 190 mph top speed Lamborghini Gallardo.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Somewhere only we know</li>
              <li>Siple faith where have you gone? So tell where you're gonna let me in.</li>
              <li>Talk about it somewhere only we know. This could be the end of everything. So why don't we go somewhere only we know?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Despite these outrageous price tags, none of these high-end patrol cars is close to being the priciest police car in the world.</p>
          <p>British patrolmen joined the limelight when they bought the finest police vehicle to date: a 207 mph McLaren worth $398,122/each. <a href="#">Even Dubai couldn't have beaten British cops</a> with their humble McLaren coupe units. Not until UAE police acquired a 220 mph Aston Martin One-77, estimated to be worth a jaw-dropping $1,829,960 - indubitably the world's most expensive police car. Only 77 units of this model has been sold because it was meant to be the manufacturing company's ultimate vehicle model.</p>
          <p>It goes without saying that Dubai is the worst and best place to commit speeding or any traffic violation. Aston Martin One-77 serves as UAE traffic offenders' worst nightmare; at the same time, it's the key to fulfilling the dream ride of every police officer.</p>
